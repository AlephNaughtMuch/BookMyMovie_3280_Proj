Dir Guide:

- HTML/CSS/JS — all front-end files

- SQL — all SQL files

- PHP — all PHP code

- OTHER_FILES — other project-related files

NOTES:

In HTML/CSS/JS Folders, since in Java we need JSP files - same html files but slightly modified to work with Spring MVC, to html files there is one tsp added for final confirmation page. Use it also, just delete weird unnecessary stuff from it.
